for now it seems that doing this is necessary for the basics to work

As an ArchLinux user, I was unable to get synergy to work with just this. I also had to define XAUTHORITY. To make this properly generic, I had to create my own service file.

The following file is: /etc/systemd/system/synergy@myusername.service

[Unit]
Description=Synergy Service [multiuser fixed]
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=on-abnormal
RestartSec=0
SyslogLevel=err
Environment=DISPLAY=:0
Environment=XAUTHORITY=/home/%i/.Xauthority
ExecStart=/usr/bin/synergy-service

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Once this file is in place, enable it like so

systemctl enable synergy@myusername.service

Where "myusername" is the name of your home directory.

```

additionally, it seems that the service refuses to die (only when restarting/shutting down),
adding this
```
TimeoutStopSec=5
```
to the `Service` section should be enough
